# StudySpot
A campus study table status solution 

## How to build
1. <code>npm install</code> to get all dependencies.
2. <code>npm run dev</code> to run the vue app itself. Server should fire up at localhost:3175.
3. Go to the <code>db</code> folder under <code>src</code> and 
<code>node server.cjs</code>. Server should fire up at localhost:3000.

## Other tools
Use Webstorm/Vscode for developing, I like webstorm. 
<br>
Use db browser for sqlite to operate on the database. Database should be called <code>test.db</code>
and located under <code>.\src\db</code>

## Licence
No licence yet but I think I have poor man's copyright.
